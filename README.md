## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- scss - [Sassy Cascading Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for/)

### What I learned

I learned a little more about tables because in this challenge, there were certain table obstacles that I worked on the most. And also list items bullets, this was also one of the obstacles, and now I know how to make list items bullets using before and after.

```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

### Continued development

First I want to finish the javascript course I'm taking on freecodecamp, I'm also going through the learning path on Frontendmentor, and after that I want to focus more on React, Next.js and Node.js.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - He is my hero, if I need something fast, if I can't understand something, or if I can't find it on the internet, I always ask him.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
